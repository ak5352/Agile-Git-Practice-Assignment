This article about tracking user navigation on websites was interesting to me because it sheds light on the increasing importance of powerful user interface design.
It is common knowledge now that having a clean, well-designed website is important to attracting people to that website and even the company that owns the website. Yet
if the website is not able to provide the user with what the user wants, then what's the point of it looking all neat and pretty? This article argues that by including 
behavioral analytics on one's website--tracking where the users navigate, what they click on, and even how long they stay on the website--we can increase our understanding
of how users interact with software. This data, rather than the traffic a website receives, proves invaluable to designing a powerful user experience because we can actually
see what aspects of the software remain undiscovered and what aspects are the most accessible. We can understand what users want from our software and what makes them want
to switch to another piece of software. Behavioral analytics, thus, is an essential part in software development, for it brings us software developers closer to the user.

Many websites and companies only rely on some basic web analytics such as Google Analytics but that does not caputre the full story. It is interesting to see that behavioral analytics shows the bigger picture and how the users actually interact with the website and whether they find it useful. I will definitely incorporate it to my future products.
